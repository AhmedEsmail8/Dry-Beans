# Dry-Beans
The "Dry Beans  Classification" project aims to predict and classify three distinct categories of dry beans: Bombay, Cali, and Sira. This classification is based on measurements of five significant features: Area, Perimeter, MajorAxisLength, MinorAxisLength, and Roundness, each measured in millimeters.
